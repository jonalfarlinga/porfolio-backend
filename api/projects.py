            <b>The Pitch:</b>  Log into our app to see a record of all of your sightings of any bird on our app (currently 333 North American species). Sightings include the bird's common name, location and geographic coordinates along with a retrieved via url link. Go to the Birds List and view all of the species  in our database with the ability to search by name or filter by sighted status.

            <b>The Work:</b> We created a PostgreSQL database, a Python FastAPI backend, and a Javascript React frontend. We fill our database of birds and images with data from Nuthatch API and we use Google Geocode and eBirds 2.0 API to retrieve and display observations nearby to the user.

                I struggled for a time with my role in the project: I had a strong vision and understood all the parts in the process we would need to complete the project. But this was not my own project, and everyone needed to have a hand in creating it. I very much wanted to take ownership and direct the others, and I feel that was needed, but I didn't want to limit their ownership because this was a class project, not real life. I also held back in critiquing and instructing at times because I didn't want to override their learning experiences. </p>

            <b>The Pitch:</b> Class starts next week, and you haven't created a syllabus yet. You need to get it done, but just building the table is such a  hassle. Open a text editor and a calendar. You start filling in the dates, but was Spring break the 13th or the 15th? Now bust out the Academic Calendar and verify the holidays that fall on your class periods. Oh yeah, you don't have class on Monday, so take out the MLK holiday!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            <b>The Work:</b> I first created a terminal app using Python's BeautifulSoup library.  The app would scrape the institution's web site for academic calendar data and use that to create a .docx output which includes a table of class meeting dates with holidays filled in.
            </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
                I then ported the code to a React and Django full-stack app. I later rebuilt the app using FastAPI for the backend. The current iteration of Calends-Online doesn't need a database or authorization, so it made more sense to serve the API through FastAPI with only the Python logic and the API router.
                On the web, I build and render a table in HTML, which the user can highlight and copy into their favorite text editor. The table is created in an otherwise invisible div and rendered when it becomes relevant.

            <p>
                <b>I learned a lot about how I learn.</b> I already knew that I prefer to learn by doing.  When I started using Beautiful Soup, at first I wasn't getting what I expected from my script. After a few attempts at writing code, I decided to open a Python interpreter so that I could quickly iterate through changes in the code. By reviewing docs and attempting several different commands in the interpreter, I gained a thorough knowledge of both BS4 and the webpage I was working with. I realized that while documents can be helpful, I find them much more helpful after I've started using the API and failed a few times.

          <li>
            <p>
                <b>I like building useful projects.</b> Calends was born of an idle request by a professor I know. She was frustrated with the tedium of creating academic calendars for each class each semester. It was a simple problem that is unreasonably hard to accomplish. Once I presented it to my wife, she was so excited, she told a friend and they both used it immediately. That result was far more reward per effort than any of my previous "for fun" projects.
